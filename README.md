## Purpose
This repository contains an assignment for the FCAI OOP Programming course in 2023. The assignment focuses on creating a photo editing app that can apply various filters to both grayscale and RGB images. The project is designed to offer basic image manipulation functionalities and explore object-oriented programming concepts.

## Features
- Load and manipulate grayscale and RGB images.
- Apply various image filters.
- Save the edited image.
- Detailed documentation on available filters and options.
- Mode auto-detection: Detects the image color mode (RGB or grayscale) to apply the correct algorithm.
- Smart frame: Generates a frame color based on the average image contrast.
- Error handling: Ensures user input validation.
- Quick save mode: Allows users to input a filename for quick save.

## Filters
1. **Black and White Filter:** Converts the image to grayscale.
2. **Invert:** Creates a negative of the image.
3. **Merge (Functionality in Progress):** Allows you to merge two images (functionality to be added).
4. **Flip:** Flip the image horizontally or vertically.
5. **Change Brightness:** Adjust the brightness of the image.
6. **Rotate:** Rotate the image.
7. **Detect Edges:** Highlight edges in the image.
8. **Enlarge:** Increase the size of the image.
9. **Shrink:** Reduce the size of the image.
10. **Mirror:** Create a mirrored image.
11. **Add Smart Frame:** Add a decorative frame to the image.
12. **Get Average Pixels Contrast (Advanced):** Calculate and display the average contrast of pixels in the image.
13. **Shuffle:** Shuffle the pixels in the image.
14. **Blur:** Apply a blur effect to the image.
15. **Crop:** Crop a portion of the image.
16. **Skew:** Skew the image.
17. **Credits:** View the credits for this application.
18. **Save Image to a File:** Save the edited image to a file.
19. **Exit:** Close the application.
